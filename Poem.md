    *By Paul Cameron Brown



    *The long finger of blackness is holding its head for us.
    Dingy bue is its shade,
    comatose in movement, hazarding a slow swiftness,
    it inches toward us.

    Relief comes fitfully.
    The dragon alone, an upstart
    crowned with drunken spending,
    has horse colours as ribbons with his eyes.
    It cradles a breast of trembling bone.

    Misercorde, Misercorde.
    I dreamt I saw skeletal slackness
    dangling;
    the poverty of touch is a casket
    with love in rumbling sockets.
    Craziness is the passion of the engulfed,
    dribbling pleasantly.

    Presentations extended beyond and into themselves.
    Slackness schemes with invalid awareness
    _in a brothel of hope._
